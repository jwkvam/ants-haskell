Haskell starter bot for the 2011 Google AI Challenge - Ants

Reimplement the doTurn function in MyBot.hs, just don't change its signature.
Look in Ants.hs to see what data is available from GameParams and GameState.

To compile, simply run from the command line
> ghc --make -O MyBot

You may check for updates from the following repository.

Invoke ghc with optimizations turned on with the -O flag. This eliminates
unnecessary copying of arrays, see unsafeFreeze and unsafeThaw at
